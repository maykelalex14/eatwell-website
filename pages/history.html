<h2>How It All Started</h2>
<img src="../images/eatwell.jpg" alt="Eat Well" width="500">
<p>I have  always loved football. It was my life and i was playing most of the time. Every day after school, I would meet my best friend, who was also my teammate. He was from Asia, and his love for his culture was incredible. He was always talking about the food from his home country, and I remember how excited he was to share it with me.</p>
<p>One day after practice, he brought me a dish he said I had to try. It was like nothing I had ever tasted before, it was full of flavors that I couldn’t even describe. He told me about all the different foods from his country, and I realized how much I enjoyed them. Over time, he introduced me to more dishes, and I started loving Asian food more and more.</p>

<h2>Our Dream</h2>
<p>We played football together for years, and we became closer, sharing not just the game but our love for food. One day, we had an idea,why not open a restaurant that serves the best Asian food, a place where people can enjoy the same meals we loved after a football game? We wanted to create a space where people could come together, share good food, and feel the same way we did after a great match.</p>
<p>That’s how Eat Well was born in 2018. It was the perfect mix of my love for football and his passion for his culture. We worked hard, and our dream became a reality. Now, our restaurant isn’t just about the food; it’s about bringing people together, just like football did for us. Eat Well is where good food and good memories are always served.</p>
